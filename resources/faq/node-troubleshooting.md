# ‚ùå Node Troubleshooting

## Why is my node not earning POKT?

## How do I check my Pocket node status?

Make sure your node is connected to the network by executing:

```bash
curl http://<your node ip>:26657/status
```

Lookout for `latest_block_height` and `latest_block_time` to make sure it's updated to the current time in UTC.

## I keep getting "too many open files" when my node is syncing? What does this mean?

This means that your `ulimit` is set too low on your node. Find instructions on how to set your `ulimit` [here](node-configuration.md#how-do-i-set-my-ulimit).

## Why does my node keep crashing?

Your node can crash due to the following reasons:

1. Having too many open files
2. Resource limitations

### Too Many Open Files

Make sure your `ulimit` is set correctly on your user profile. Find instructions on how to set your `ulimit` [here](node-configuration.md#how-do-i-set-my-ulimit).

### Resource Limitations

Make sure your node meets the minimum hardware requirements for both a [Pocket node](node-configuration.md#what-are-the-hardware-requirements-for-running-a-pocket-node) and the blockchain nodes you're servicing.

## Will my node be slashed for downtime?

There are negligible burns at this stage of the network, determined by the [`SlashFractionDowntime`](../references/protocol-parameters.md#slashfractiondowntime) parameter. As the network matures, the rate will probably be increased to push for better service.
