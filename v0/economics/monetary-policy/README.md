# üè¶ Monetary Policy

Pocket‚Äôs staking and inflation mechanisms enable a more efficient resource allocation structure by limiting the number of transactions \(and thus block validation costs\) to one-time staking transactions. All nodes are able to focus primarily on servicing and validating Relay requests by Applications, with minimal energy spent on block validation. By being [eventually consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) and tying rewards directly to inflation, Service Nodes are in effect, receiving micropayments for work validated by two parties without the need for constant on-chain fee payments. 

### **Allocation of Minted POKT**

For each Relay served and validated by the protocol, POKT is added to the next block reward according to the mint rate. The following is a breakdown of each participant's share of the block reward given no parameter changes.

| Participant | Allocation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Service Nodes | 89% |
| Block Producer | 1% |
| DAO | 10% |

Service Nodes receive 89% for each Relay served. As part of the Proof-of-Stake consensus, each Service Node has a weighted chance of being selected to be the block producer for any given block based on the total amount staked for that given node. The block producer is eligible to receive 1% of the entire block reward. The remaining 10% of the block reward is received by the Pocket DAO, providing it with continuous and sustainable funding subject to supporting the continued adoption and utility of Pocket Network.
